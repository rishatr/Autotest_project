# Autotest_project
Wildberries business way

Description:
The project includes the implementation of the full business path of the WildBerries store: the purchase of two products.
It consists of navigating through categories, applying filters, selecting products, using search and comparing final prices.
Built using the Page Object pattern (home page and shopping cart).
As a result we get logs and screenshots.
The results of the tests can be viewed in the Allure report (cmd): allure server test_results/ 
To run use: pytest
